# MSBD5001-Fall2020-Project-Code

My team name on Kaggle is Adam Usmani

Please find my project code for the MSBD5001-Fall 2020 competition in this file 'MSBD5001 Kaggle Competiton.ipynb' 

I ran my code using Python on Jupyter Notebook. It can be re-run in the file stated above. 

The following libraries are required to run this code...

numpy
pandas
xgboost
sklearn.metrics
os
sklearn.model_selection
seaborn

I have also uploaded my test.csv file to GitHub which can be used to view the speed results for the missing times in the original data.
